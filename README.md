// File: public/images
/* Add placeholder images named p1-1.jpg, p1-2.jpg, p2-1.jpg, p3-1.jpg, p4-1.jpg, hero.jpg */


---


# Notes & next steps
- This scaffold focuses on structure and components. Replace placeholder images in `public/images` with your product photos.
- Add more products to `src/data/products.ts` to reach 12 items.
- Integrate payment gateway or backend by replacing the seed data with API calls.
- Accessibility: add aria labels and keyboard traps to modals as you expand.


Enjoy â€” open the files above, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to preview. If you want, I can now:


- generate the full 12-product seed JSON and optimized placeholder images,
- implement search, filters, and sort in the Catalog,
- produce each component as separate files in a GitHub-ready repo with unit tests.


Tell me which of those you'd like me to do next and I'll add it to this project. -->
